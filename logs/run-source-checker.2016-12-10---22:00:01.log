          'message' => 'These three reflections upon Trump\'s Election and it\'s aftermath by Shauna Richardson may be long, but they are certainly worth reading and sharing:

) We have our own intelligence agencies including the CIA telling us that Russians were directly involved in swaying this election and helping elect Donald Trump. Somehow, this is not enraging every single American and it\'s baffling. Despite your political affiliation, if you claim to be a patriot and lover of this country, this should infuriate you. This is a direct attack on our democracy and our election process. And even when we have our own intelligence agencies telling us this, people are still defending Trump. In fact, Donald Trump himself attacked our own intelligence agencies that are sworn in to protect us... to defend Russia. HOW MANY swampy people with Russian ties does Trump have to appoint to his swamp cabinet for people to believe that he\'s in fact a puppet for Putin? We, as a campaign, focused on this weeks ago and HRC herself addressed this on a national stage in front of 66 million viewers at the last debate. He claims to be a champion for the working class when EVERY single person he\'s appointed to his cabinet comes from big money or big corporations. When our President-elect appoints as many men that have been accused with domestic violence against women as he does actual women, does that not sound the alarm? When our President-elect appoints Steve Bannon, a white supremacist, to be his chief strategist, the same man that thinks women that study too hard become ugly and refused to let his children go to a school where Jewish children went, does that not sound the alarm? When our President-elect appoints a climate change denier who\'s currently suing the EPA to be in charge of the EPA, does that not sound the alarm? When our President-elect has literal meltdowns on Twitter about SNL, calls out individual Americans (which results in them receiving death threats) or trolls China with a handful of tweets but refuses to read his intelligence briefings that helps keep YOU safe, does that not sound the alarm? Or better yet, when our President-elect has the time to hold a "thank you tour" which is really a "thank me" tour and then complains that TIME should have named him "Man of the Year" and not "Person of the Year" instead of looking at those briefings, does that not sound the alarm? I could go on and on...
Also, just out of curiosity, the mainstream media spent hours and hours covering HIllary\'s emails and furthering the "corrupt" narrative. Many people were upset by that private email server. Meanwhile, our President-elect has taken phone calls on his personal, private phone and has let his daughter sit in on meetings with foreign diplomats. HIllary was attacked relentlessly for months about giving speeches to Goldman Sachs. Our President-elect has actually appointed top Goldman Sachs execs to his cabinet. HIllary and her relationship to the Clinton Foundation, a foundation that actually helps millions of people, was scrutinized. Our President-elect is clearly abusing power and creating a conflict of interest with his own shady organization and settled a fraud cause for his phony university. HIllary was attacked for months about President Clinton and we all watched Trump go so low that it was almost unbearable for that second debate when he talked about President Clinton\'s past. Our President-elect was caught on a hot mic openly bragging about sexually assaulting women. Not only that, he didn\'t really apologize. And, when women did come forward to talk about the assaults, Trump denied it and then doubled down by saying they weren\'t attractive enough for him to assault. So, how is everyone feeling about all of those things now?

2) Telling us that we just need to "get over it". Yep, that\'s not a thing. This wasn\'t about us losing as a campaign. We see the bigger picture and what it means for all Americans. This is not because a Republican won and a Democrat lost. It\'s because we already see women\'s rights being restricted in Texas and Ohio. It\'s because we see our President-elect continuing to appoint people who have a long history of attempting to restrict women\'s rights and a past of LGBTQ discrimination. It\'s because hate crimes have skyrocketed since the election against Muslims, people of color, women, and others. It\'s because we\'ve seen video of the "alt-right"... wait, just kidding, white supremacists talking about the superiority of their race while giving Nazi salutes a few doors down from the White House in DC. It\'s because this election was a slap in the face to women everywhere because it told us that you can be more qualified, prepared, respectful, inclusive, and rightfully ambitious and confident, and still lose the job to an unqualified, unhinged, dangerous man that ran on a divisive platform of fear. It\'s because people are saying there was no enthusiasm for our candidate, or the platform she ran when this is not true. In fact, it\'s disrespectful and simply ridiculous. HRC earned more votes than any other man (aside from President Obama in his first run in 2008) who\'s ever run for the presidency. It\'s because we know what it means for a lot of people if Trump gets his hands on the Supreme Court. It\'s because we know that Republicans want to repeal Obamacare, which provides healthcare to millions of Americans that need it to survive. It\'s because we know that this election has set us back decades in terms of progress. It\'s because we know that common sense gun control is completely written off. It\'s because we know that the economy will take a major hit, which is something several unbiased economists warned us about. It\'s because we know that climate change is real because science is real and our GOP friends think it\'s a hoax. It\'s because we know he wants to rip thousands of families apart and seal the deal with a wall. It\'s because we know that hate was on the ballot and it won the Electoral College. 

3) When will enough be enough? How many times will Trump do or say something completely insane and still not have any consequences? It certainly wasn\'t him bragging about sexually assaulting women, his fraudulent university that robbed people of their life savings, his constant support for Russia despite our own intelligence agencies saying that Russia is a direct threat to our country, him inciting violence at rally after rally by encouraging his supporters to "beat the crap out of \'em", him threatening to jail his opponent, him threatening citizens with jail time or loss of citizenship for exercising their constitutional right under the First Amendment but not taking the time to condemn hate crimes being carried out in his name, telling women they need to be punished for making a decision that should only be between them, their personal faith, and their doctor, mocking a disabled reporter, suggesting war crimes as a solution for stopping terrorism, constantly lying to the American people like saying he didn\'t support the Iraq War when he did or when he declared that he never said that Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons (he did.. it\'s on video), and it certainly wasn\'t him losing all three debates due to his inability to talk policy or have steady hands. So, when will it be enough? When will Republican leadership actually act on their "love of country" and stand up and put the American people first? When will, other than Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican leaders finally acknowledge that this is flat out dangerous and morally irresponsible? This is way beyond party lines, folks. This isn\'t something that the country can just bounce back from. Our decisions now matter. Our refusal to sit back and watch this happen matters.

I\'m in awe of the American citizens, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike that are standing up for what is right and looking past their political affiliation. Don\'t stop speaking. Please. The world is watching. Our country\'s destiny should be a reflection of the majority of Americans and the best of who we are. What we choose to do now will determine the decades to come.'
